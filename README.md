MV5 Tutorials using VS 2017 and Razor

### Movies List
- Created a website application using .NET Core and Razor view pages to display a list of movies
- Movies list is editable using CRUD methods and validated using regular expressions and validation tokens
- Movies list is repopulated when no movies are saved in the database. The error of the ratings field not showing up was due to this methodology.

### University
- Created a website application using .NET Core and Razor view pages to display academic information used in administration.
- University models include Instructor, Student, Courses, Assignments and several more classes to build the project
- Each model has their own view pages which follow CRUD methods and validated using regular expressions, validation tokens and C# data attributes
- Allows for concurrency handling and multiple page viewing.

### Web API
- Created a website application using .NET Web Api template to emulate api calls from the web
- Used C# serializable attributes to convert C# data into JSON and HTML parsable requests
