MV5 Tutorial using VS 2017 and Razor

- Created a website using .NET Core and Razor view pages to display a list of movies
- Movies list is editable using CRUD methods and validated using regular expressions and validation tokens
- Movies list is repopulated when no movies are saved in the database. The error of the ratings field not showing up was due to this methodology.
